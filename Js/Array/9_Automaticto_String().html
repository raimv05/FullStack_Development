ðŸ‘‰ Arrays automatically become strings when printed.
Real Life Example: Showing fruits as a shopping list. 
ðŸ‘‰ Practical Example:

Imagine writing your own name on a paper â†’ you did it explicitly.

Someone else writing your name automatically for you when asked â†’ implicit.

Both results are the same, but one is done by you, the other by the system.-->
