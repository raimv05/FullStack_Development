        📝 Problem Statement: Build a Simple Algo Trading Bot in JavaScript

-> Background

In algorithmic trading, bots automatically make decisions to buy, sell, or hold stocks based on predefined rules. In this problem, you will simulate a very simple trading bot using JavaScript fundamentals.

-> Task

You are required to build a basic algo trading bot simulation that:

Tracks balance, stock price, and holdings using variables.

Uses operators (arithmetic and comparison) to calculate and compare values.

Implements functions to update prices, decide actions, and execute trades.

-> Requirements

-> Initial Setup:

Start with a balance of 1000.

Stock price starts at 100.

No stocks are held initially (holdings = 0).

-> Update Stock Price:

Write a function updatePrice() that randomly generates a stock price between 80 and 120.

-> Decide Action:

Write a function decideAction(price) that follows these rules:

If stock price < 90 → Action = BUY (if balance allows).

If stock price > 110 → Action = SELL (if holdings > 0).

Otherwise → Action = HOLD.

-> Execute Trade:

Write a function trade(action) that:

BUY: Deduct the stock price from balance and increase holdings by 1.

SELL: Add the stock price to balance and decrease holdings by 1.

HOLD: Do nothing.

-> Simulation:

Run the bot for 10 rounds.

In each round:

Update the stock price.

Decide action.

Execute trade.

Print the stock price, action taken, current balance, and holdings.


-> Output :- 

Round 1: Stock price = 85 → Action = BUY → Balance = 915, Holdings = 1
Round 2: Stock price = 112 → Action = SELL → Balance = 1027, Holdings = 0
Round 3: Stock price = 95 → Action = HOLD → Balance = 1027, Holdings = 0
