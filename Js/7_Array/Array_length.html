<!-- 1. Array length

ðŸ‘‰ The length property tells how many items are in an array.
You can also use it to cut an array.

Real-life Example:
Imagine you have a basket of fruits. You want to know how many fruits are inside. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>Array length Example</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

// Count number of fruits
let size = fruits.length;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
"Number of fruits: " + size;
</script>
</body>
</html>
<!-- ðŸ”¹ If you set fruits.length = 2; â†’ basket keeps only first 2 fruits. -->
