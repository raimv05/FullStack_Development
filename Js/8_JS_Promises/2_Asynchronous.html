<!-- 🔹 What is Asynchronous JavaScript?

👉 Normally, JavaScript is synchronous (runs one line at a time in order).
But sometimes, we need to wait for something (like a timer ⏳, API response 🌐, or user action 🖱️).

Instead of blocking everything while waiting, JavaScript uses asynchronous functions → they keep working in the background and call you back when ready.

✅ Real-Life Analogy

Synchronous (Normal): You cook Maggi 🍜 and stand near the stove until it’s done. You can’t do anything else.

Asynchronous: You put Maggi on the stove ⏳, set a timer ⏰, and go watch TV 📺. When the timer rings, you return and eat.
👉 This is exactly what JavaScript does with setTimeout and setInterval. -->
<!-- ✅ Example 1: Callback with Calculator (Simple) -->
 
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>Asynchronous Example 1</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myDisplayer(something) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = something;
}

function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  myCallback(sum);  // call display function
}

myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 👉 Here, myCalculator does math first, then calls back myDisplayer with the result.
This is synchronous but shows the idea of callback. -->
